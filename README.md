# RailwayNetwork Simulation

We have all wondered that so many people travel on a daily basis on trains, but how do the network
actually work ? 
What is the process behind the Rail network ? 
Here in our project: The Railway Network, we have tried to explain how the Billing System, the Reservation and the
Accounts Department works.

## Objectives
The main objective of the this project is to understand how to Rail Network works so efficiently
with very little to none flaws and we have been using Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate the whole
thing.
